# Attempt at 2D tiling textures

Tiling works fine in 3D but fails in 2D

- `cargo run --example 3d_tiling` - works fine shows a 2x2 tiled texture
- `cargo run --example 2d_tiling` - camera changed to 2D and it no longer works. There is a blank white quad above from where the tiling should appear, the difference being the material.

Please fork and make a pull request if you know how to make this. Solution for 2D is all I care about, if it breaks on 3D it's fine.
